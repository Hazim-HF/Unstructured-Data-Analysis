[Pre-Chorus]
"I check the doors, check the windows and pull the blinds"
"I check the clock, wondering what he'll pull this time"
I have a feeling that necromancer's outside
And I'm just tryin' to stay quiet

[Chorus]
"I don't sleep much, that's crazy, how'd you know that?"
"Keep myself up, that's maybe how you know that"
"Ooh, promises and contracts I used to keep"
"I don't sleep much, that's crazy, how'd you know that?"
"Keep myself up, that's maybe how you know that"
"Ooh, my hallucination I used to see"

[Verse]
"Wake up and I find out, did a change up"
"Wait, did it change up?"
"Is it light out yet? Better find out, bet"
I'ma walk around the edge of the room and the bed
"Where I hide my face, pace around"
"Better try to br?athe, pace around, pace around"

[Pre-Chorus]
"I check the doors, check the windows, and pull the blinds"
"I check the clock, wondering what he'll pull this time"
I have a feeling that necromancer's outside
And I'm just tryin' to stay quiet
