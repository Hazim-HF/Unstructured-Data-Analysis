[Verse 1]
I praise Allah for sending me you my love
You've found your home it's here with me
"And I'm here with you, now let me let you know"
You've opened my heart
I was always thinking that love was wrong
"But everything was changed when you came along, oh"
And there's a couple of words I want to say

[Chorus]
"For the rest of my life, I'll be with you"
"I'll stay by your side, honest and true"
Till the end of my time
"I'll be loving you, loving you"
"For the rest of my life, through days and nights"
I'll thank Allah for opening my eyes
"Now and forever I, I'll be there for you"
I know it deep in my heart

[Verse 2]
I feel so blessed when I think of you
And I ask Allah to bless all we do
You're my wife and my friend and my strength
And I pray we're together in Jannah
"Finally now I've found myself, I feel so strong"
"Yes, everything was changed when you came along, oh"
And there's a couple of words I want to say

[Chorus]
"For the rest of my life, I'll be with you"
"I'll stay by your side, honest and true"
Till the end of my time
"I'll be loving you, loving you"
"For the rest of my life, through days and nights"
I'll thank Allah for opening my eyes
"Now and forever I, I'll be there for you"
I know it deep in my heart

[Bridge]
"And now that you're here, in front of me"
I strongly feel love
"And I have no doubt, and I'll sing it loud"
And that I will love you eternally

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
"For the rest of my life, I'll be with you"
"I'll stay by your side, honest and true"
Till the end of my time
"I'll be loving you, loving you"
"For the rest of my life, through days and nights"
I'll thank Allah for opening my eyes
"Now and forever I, I'll be there for you"
I know it deep in my heart
